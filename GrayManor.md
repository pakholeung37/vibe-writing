# Gray Manor

## Overview

Gray Manor is the ancestral home of the Gray family and the crime scene where [[Victoria Gray]] was murdered. A Victorian-era mansion on the outskirts of the city, it represents old money, family secrets, and the isolation of wealth. Every room holds memories; every shadow hides something.

## Description

The manor sits on twelve acres of manicured grounds, approached by a long private drive lined with oak trees. The building itself is three stories of gray stone—hence the family name—with a steep slate roof, tall windows, and a covered entrance portico.

Inside, the house is a museum of accumulated generations. Dark wood paneling, oriental carpets, oil paintings of stern ancestors. The furniture is antique and uncomfortable. Modern conveniences have been added reluctantly: central heating that clanks in the pipes, electrical wiring visible in corners, a kitchen updated sometime in the 1980s.

The overall impression is of wealth preserved in amber—impressive but lifeless, beautiful but cold.

## Atmosphere

- **Sound**: Creaking floors, ticking clocks, wind against old windows
- **Smell**: Old wood, furniture polish, dust in unused rooms
- **Light**: Filtered through heavy drapes, always slightly dim
- **Mood**: Oppressive grandeur, watching portraits, secrets in walls

## Key Areas

### The Study
Where Victoria died. A wood-paneled room on the ground floor. Heavy desk facing the door. Walls lined with books. A fireplace, cold now. Victoria's body was found slumped at the desk, appearing to have died while writing.

### The East Wing
Where [[Elena Ross]] has her quarters. A separate apartment with private entrance—ostensibly for privacy, practically meaning her movements that night are unverified.

### The West Wing
Guest rooms, mostly unused. [[Marcus Wells]] stayed here during his brief time as Victoria's ward. Now dusty and draped in sheets.

### The Kitchen
Domain of [[Mrs. Patterson]]. Modernized but still old-fashioned. The household hub where gossip accumulates.

### The Grounds
Formal gardens gone slightly wild. An old carriage house converted to garage. A family cemetery where [[Richard Gray]] is buried.

## History

Built in 1895 by Richard Gray's great-grandfather, the manor has housed four generations of Grays. Each generation added their mark: the library, the conservatory (now sealed after water damage), the east wing extension.

[[Richard Gray]] and [[Victoria Gray]] lived here as a couple for fifteen years. After Richard's death, Victoria remained, alone except for staff. She rarely entertained, seldom left. The manor became her prison and her protection.

## Associated Characters

- [[Victoria Gray]]: Lived and died here
- [[Elena Ross]]: Resided in the east wing
- [[Mrs. Patterson]]: Comes daily to maintain the house
- [[Marcus Wells]]: Lived here briefly as a teenager; visited the night of the murder
- [[Richard Gray]]: Died here fifteen years ago

## Security

- Old-fashioned: no cameras, no electronic systems
- Locks on exterior doors, rarely used
- [[Elena Ross]] has keys to everything
- [[Mrs. Patterson]] has keys to common areas
- [[Marcus Wells]] may still have a key from his teenage years

## Notes

- The house should feel like a character—oppressive, watching, keeping secrets
- Contrast the grandeur with the emptiness
- Weather should reflect mood: autumn, overcast, approaching storm
- The study is central: multiple scenes take place there
