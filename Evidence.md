# Evidence

## Overview

This file tracks all evidence in the murder of [[Victoria Gray]]. It serves as both an in-story reference for [[Detective Chen]]'s investigation and a writer's tool for ensuring fair-play mystery construction.

## Physical Evidence

### The Body
- **Location**: Found at desk in study, [[Gray Manor]]
- **Position**: Slumped forward, as if she fell asleep
- **Time of Death**: Between 11 PM and 1 AM
- **Initial Assessment**: Natural causes (heart failure)
- **Revised Assessment**: Poisoning (digitalis)

### The Study
- **Desk**: Victoria was writing something—pages found
- **Tea Cup**: Empty, residue sent for analysis
- **Papers**: Half-finished letter (contents TBD)
- **Safe**: Closed, not obviously tampered with
- **Windows**: Locked from inside
- **Door**: Unlocked (unusual per [[Elena Ross]])

### Toxicology
- **Substance**: Digitalis (derived from foxglove)
- **Effect**: Heart failure in someone with existing cardiac issues
- **Source**: Victoria took prescription digitalis for heart condition
- **Overdose**: Massive, would cause death within hours
- **Delivery Method**: Likely in evening tea (to be confirmed)

### Other Physical Evidence
- **Fingerprints**: Multiple sets being analyzed
- **Visitor Log**: None kept
- **Security Footage**: No cameras installed
- **Guest Book**: Last entry months ago

## Testimonial Evidence

- Heard argument between Victoria and Marcus (~10 PM)
- Heard Marcus leave (~11 PM)
- Found body at 7:30 AM
- Claims to have loved Victoria

### Marcus Wells
- Arrived at manor ~10 PM
- Argues he came to reconcile
- Admits to heated argument about money
- Claims he left at 11 PM
- Gas station receipt at 11:47 PM (45-minute drive)

## Timeline Gaps

| Time | Marcus Claims | Elena Claims | Verified |
|------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| 10:00 PM | Arrived | Heard arrival | ✓ (Mrs. P heard argument from outside) |
| 11:00 PM | Left | Heard leaving | ✗ No witness |
| 11:00 PM - 1:00 AM | Driving | Sleeping | ✗ Neither verified |
| 11:47 PM | Gas station | N/A | ✓ Receipt |

## Key Questions

1. Who had access to Victoria's digitalis prescription?
2. Was the tea cup the delivery method?
3. What was Victoria writing when she died?
4. Why was the study door unlocked?
5. What happened in the 47-minute gap in Marcus's alibi?
6. Can Elena's claim of sleeping be verified?

## Clues to Plant

For fair-play mystery, readers should be able to solve with these clues:

### Chapter 1 Clues
- [ ] The study door being unlocked (Elena has key, but usually locks it)
- [ ] Victoria's teacup—Chen notices it specifically
- [ ] Something odd about the desk arrangement

### Later Clues
- [ ] Victoria's prescription bottle (count pills)
- [ ] The half-finished letter (reveals fear)
- [ ] Elena's knowledge of Victoria's medication schedule
- [ ] Marcus's key to the manor (still has one)
- [ ] [[Mrs. Patterson]]'s observation about recent changes

## Red Herrings

- Marcus's gambling debts (motive, but too obvious)
- The gas station receipt (partially alibis him but has gap)
- Elena's grief (appears genuine—is it?)
- Rumors about [[Richard Gray]]'s death (connects thematically, not literally)

## Notes

- Keep evidence list updated as chapters are written
- Verify each clue is actually in the text
- All evidence should be discoverable before the reveal
- The killer must have means, motive, and opportunity—prove all three
