# Detective Chen

## Overview

Detective Li Chen is a veteran homicide investigator with [[Riverside Station]]. Methodical and observant, she has built her career on noticing what others miss. The [[Gray Manor]] case will test both her professional skills and personal demons.

## Background

Chen grew up in the city, daughter of immigrants who ran a small restaurant. She joined the police force at 22, driven by a desire for order and justice in a chaotic world. Twenty years on the force have sharpened her instincts but also accumulated scars.

Her defining moment came early in her career: a case she couldn't solve. A young woman found dead, evidence pointing everywhere and nowhere. The case went cold. Chen still keeps the file in her desk drawer. It taught her that some puzzles resist solving—and that failure lingers.

She rose through the ranks on merit, earning respect for her closure rate and her refusal to take shortcuts. But she's also earned a reputation for being difficult—too thorough, too questioning, unwilling to accept easy answers.

## Personality

**Traits:**
- Observational: Notices details others overlook
- Patient: Willing to wait for the right moment
- Stubborn: Won't let go of something that doesn't fit
- Private: Keeps personal life separate from work

**Motivations:**
- Justice for victims who can't speak for themselves
- Proving that truth can be found
- Redemption for her unsolved case

**Flaws:**
- Difficulty trusting others with important work
- Tendency to become obsessed with cases
- Suppresses emotions until they overflow

## Relationships

- [[Victoria Gray]]: The victim. Chen never met her alive but comes to understand her through investigation.
- [[Elena Ross]]: Primary witness. Chen finds her grief convincing but remains professionally suspicious.
- [[Marcus Wells]]: Chief suspect. His nervousness triggers Chen's instincts.
- Partner (unnamed): Chen works largely alone, prefers it that way.

## Appearance

Mid-forties, Chinese-American woman. Black hair streaked with gray, worn short and practical. Dark eyes that miss nothing. Average height, lean build. Dresses professionally but without vanity—dark suits, sensible shoes. A small scar on her left hand from an early case.

## Mannerisms

- Taps her pen when thinking
- Takes notes constantly, even when recording
- Drinks black coffee, too much of it
- Speaks softly, forcing others to lean in and listen
- Long pauses before answering questions

## Notes

- POV character for the story
- Her cold case should parallel the Gray case thematically
- Growth arc: learning to trust others, accepting that some things can't be solved alone
- Voice: precise, observant, occasionally dry humor
