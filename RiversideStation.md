# Riverside Station

## Overview

Riverside Station is the police precinct where [[Detective Chen]] works. A functional government building that serves as the operational counterpoint to [[Gray Manor]]'s gothic atmosphere. Here, the investigation is processed, evidence analyzed, and cases solved—or go cold.

## Description

A mid-century municipal building, three stories of beige brick and institutional windows. The interior is fluorescent lights, linoleum floors, and cubicle dividers. It smells of coffee, printer toner, and the particular staleness of bureaucracy.

The homicide division occupies the second floor: an open bullpen of desks, interview rooms along one wall, the captain's office in the corner. Everything is practical, worn, budget-conscious. No one works here for the ambiance.

## Atmosphere

- **Sound**: Ringing phones, keyboard clatter, muffled conversations
- **Smell**: Coffee (burnt), fast food, industrial cleaning products
- **Light**: Harsh fluorescent, headache-inducing
- **Mood**: Professional exhaustion, grim determination

## Key Areas

### Chen's Desk
Near the window, though the view is just the parking lot. Notably organized compared to colleagues. A locked drawer holds her cold case file. Photos of solved cases on the wall—not trophies, reminders.

### Interview Rooms
Three rooms, identical. Table, chairs, recording equipment, one-way glass. Where Chen will question [[Marcus Wells]], [[Elena Ross]], and others. The rooms are designed to be uncomfortable.

### Evidence Room
Basement level. Where physical evidence from [[Gray Manor]] is catalogued and stored. Chen will return here multiple times as the case develops.

### Captain's Office
Glass-walled corner office. Captain Morrison—supportive but under pressure for results. The Gray case is high-profile; there will be scrutiny.

## Role in Story

The station provides contrast to the manor:

| Gray Manor | Riverside Station |
|------------|-------------------|
| Old money | Public service |
| Secrets | Procedure |
| Shadows | Fluorescent light |
| Emotion | Logic |

Chen moves between these worlds, bringing the discipline of the station to penetrate the mysteries of the manor.

## Associated Characters

- [[Detective Chen]]: Her professional home, where she does the methodical work
- Captain Morrison (unnamed in main text): Chen's supervisor
- Partner (unnamed): Theoretically assigned but Chen works alone

## Notes

- Use sparingly—most action is at the manor
- Good for transition scenes, receiving evidence results
- Chen's cold case file is here—if she reviews it, this is where
- The mundane environment can ground the story's more atmospheric elements
