## Chapter Content

The call came at 9:47 on a Tuesday morning.

Chen was at her desk, reviewing a file that didn't matter, when her phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen—dispatch, not her personal line—and felt that small electric shift in her chest. After twenty years, the body still knew before the mind: something had happened.

"Detective Chen."

"We've got a death at Gray Manor. 1847 Oak Hill Drive. Responding officers request a detective."

Chen wrote down the address, though she didn't need to. Everyone in the city knew Gray Manor. Old money, old family, old scandals whispered at dinner parties she was never invited to.

"What's the situation?"

"Female, seventies, found deceased in her home study. Initial assessment is natural causes. Heart failure."

"Then why do they want a detective?"

A pause. "The responding officer says something feels off. He can't explain it. Wants fresh eyes."

Fresh eyes. Chen almost smiled. Her eyes hadn't been fresh in years. But Officer—she checked the dispatch notes—Officer Warren had good instincts. She'd worked with him before. If Warren thought something was wrong, something was probably wrong.

"I'm on my way."

The drive took twenty-five minutes, long enough for Chen to review what she knew about the Grays. Not much, officially. The family had been wealthy since before wealth required explanation. The last Gray—Victoria—had lived alone in the manor since her husband's death fifteen years ago. There had been rumors about that death, too. Whispers that never became allegations. Money had a way of silencing questions.

Chen turned onto Oak Hill Drive and the city fell away. Here, the houses hid behind walls and gates and carefully positioned trees. Privacy was the ultimate luxury. No one saw anything; no one knew anything; no one talked to police without lawyers present.

The manor's gate stood open, a patrol car parked just inside. Chen pulled past it and followed the drive through a tunnel of oak trees, their autumn leaves filtering the gray morning light. The house emerged gradually: three stories of dark stone, steep rooflines, windows like watching eyes.

She parked behind the ambulance that wouldn't be taking anyone to the hospital.

Officer Warren met her at the door. Young, earnest, already apologizing.

"Detective, I know this probably looks routine—"

"You called for a reason. Show me."

He nodded, grateful not to explain himself. "The body's in the study. The assistant found her this morning. Woman named Elena Ross. She's in the sitting room with my partner."

"The assistant lives here?"

"Separate quarters in the east wing. Says she brought Mrs. Gray her morning tea at 7:30 and found her at her desk. Thought she was asleep at first."

Chen filed that away. "Who else is in the house?"

"Just the assistant last night. There's a housekeeper, but she went home at six yesterday. We're getting contact information."

They passed through a foyer that smelled of old wood and money. Portraits lined the walls—generations of Grays staring down with the particular arrogance of inherited wealth. Chen ignored them and followed Warren to a door at the end of the hall.

"The study," he said, and stepped aside.

Victoria Gray sat at her desk as if taking a rest between sentences.

She was slumped forward, head on her arms, white hair spilling across dark wood. A pen lay near her right hand. Papers scattered beneath her—a letter, half-written, the ink still sharp. Whatever she'd been composing, death had interrupted mid-thought.

Chen approached slowly, reading the room before the body.

The study was paneled in walnut, books floor to ceiling, a fireplace cold and clean. Heavy drapes half-drawn. The desk faced the door—Victoria would have seen anyone who entered. On the desk: the papers, the pen, a brass lamp, and a teacup. Empty. White porcelain with a blue pattern, the kind of cup that cost more than Chen made in a day.

She leaned closer, not touching. Victoria Gray in death looked peaceful. No sign of struggle, no obvious injury. Just an old woman who fell asleep and didn't wake up.

Except.

Chen straightened and looked at the door. Looked at Warren.

"You said the assistant found her at 7:30?"

"Yes, ma'am."

"Was this door locked?"

Warren checked his notes. "No. Miss Ross said she knocked, got no answer, and tried the handle. It opened."

"Is that normal?"

"I asked. She said Mrs. Gray always locked the study when she worked at night. Always. It was one of her—what did she call it—her habits."

Chen looked at the door again. A heavy oak door with a brass lock that looked older than she was. A door that was always locked but wasn't. A detail that didn't fit.

She moved back to the desk, to the teacup. Empty, but a residue in the bottom—dried liquid, darker than tea should be. Maybe nothing. Maybe everything.

"Officer Warren."

"Ma'am?"

"This isn't a natural death."

He exhaled, relief and dread in equal measure. "I knew something was wrong. I couldn't—"

"You did right. Now I need this room sealed. No one in or out except forensics. And I need to talk to Elena Ross."

Chen took one last look at Victoria Gray, at her peaceful, interrupted face. Whatever secrets you were keeping, she thought, they're mine now.

The teacup caught the gray light from the window, its delicate pattern almost cheerful against the somber desk.

Chen had learned long ago to trust the details that didn't fit. The unlocked door. The empty cup. The letter never finished.

Victoria Gray had something to say before she died. Someone made sure she never said it.
